      <p>
        In today’s world, audio recordings are almost always cluttered with
        background noise and overlapping speech, making manual transcription
        time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        The need for transcription documents exists not only for personal use
        but also for legal and professional purposes. Transcribers—such as
        researchers, note-takers, and journalists—often spend hours transcribing
        information from raw audio. This applies to interviews, meetings,
        courtrooms, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        With recent advances in deep learning, it is now possible to
        significantly reduce transcription time and improve productivity using
        models that perform speech separation, speaker diarization, and
        automatic transcription.
